# Social Hub Enhancement - StartLinker

## ✅ **Successfully Enhanced Social Hub as Primary Experience**

### 🎯 **What Was Accomplished**

I have successfully restructured the application to keep **Social Hub** as the main destination and merged all posts/feed features INTO it, while completely removing the Connect page.

## 🏗️ **New Social Hub Architecture**

### **Enhanced Tab Structure**
