# IMPORTANT: Django Server Restart Required

## Issue
The job approval settings have been updated, but the Django development server is still running with old cached settings in memory.

## Solution
**You need to restart the Django development server** to pick up the new `JOB_POSTING_SETTINGS`.

### Steps:

1. **Stop the current Django server:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `python manage.py runserver` is running
   - Or find the process and kill it

2. **Restart the Django server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. **Test job creation again:**
   - The jobs should now go to 'pending' status
   - They will require admin approval before being published

### Verification
After restarting, new jobs should:
- Have `status = 'pending'` 
- Have `is_active = False`
- Show message: "Job posted successfully! It will be reviewed by our admin team before being published."

### Settings Applied
```python
JOB_POSTING_SETTINGS = {
    'AUTO_APPROVE': False,  # Jobs require admin approval
    'REQUIRE_REVIEW': True,  # Force all jobs through review
    'AUTO_APPROVE_STAFF': False,  # Even staff jobs require approval  
    'AUTO_APPROVE_VERIFIED_STARTUPS': False,  # Even verified startups require approval
}
```

The settings are correctly configured - the server just needs to be restarted to load them.
