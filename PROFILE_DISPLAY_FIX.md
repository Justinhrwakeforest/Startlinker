# Profile Display Fix - Follower Count Issue

## Problem
The user profile page was showing 0 followers and 0 following, even though the backend database contained the correct counts (3 followers, 4 following).

## Root Cause
The Profile.js component was trying to fetch follower counts from non-existent API endpoints:
- `/api/auth/users/{id}/followers/` (doesn't exist)
- `/api/auth/users/{id}/following/` (doesn't exist)

Instead of using the `follower_count` and `following_count` fields that were already included in the `/api/auth/profile/` response.

## Solution
1. **Updated Profile.js** to use follower counts directly from the profile API response:
   ```javascript
   // Set follower counts from profile data
   setFollowersCount(profileRes.data.follower_count || 0);
   setFollowingCount(profileRes.data.following_count || 0);
   ```

2. **Fixed follower/following data fetching** to use correct social API endpoints:
   - `/api/social/follows/followers/` for followers list
   - `/api/social/follows/following/` for following list

3. **Updated follow/unfollow functions** to use social API endpoints:
   - `/api/social/follows/follow_user/` for following users
   - `/api/social/follows/unfollow_user/` for unfollowing users

4. **Removed duplicate functions** and cleaned up the code

## Verification
- ✅ Backend database has correct counts: 3 followers, 4 following
- ✅ Profile API endpoint returns correct data
- ✅ Frontend now displays the correct counts from profile data

## Files Modified
- `C:\Users\hruth\frontend\src\components\Profile.js`

## Result
The profile page now correctly displays:
- 3 Followers (instead of 0)
- 4 Following (instead of 0)

The follower counts are now properly synchronized between backend and frontend.
